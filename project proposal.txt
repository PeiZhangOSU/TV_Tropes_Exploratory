The aim of my project is to discover the patterns of trope usage in movies. Tropes are commonly recurring conventions and devices found within various creative works. They are essential to storytelling. Quoting from the famous website that collect trope descriptions and examples, http://tvtropes.org, "Tropes are not inherently disruptive to a story; however, when the trope itself becomes intrusive, distracting the viewer rather than serving as shorthand, it has become a clich√©." Exploring how tropes are used in creative works will help the creators identify useful and popular plot devices, and also help the audience appreciate the various devices and their function in storytelling.
